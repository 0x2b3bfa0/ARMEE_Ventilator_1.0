# Manufacturing

## Serial Numbers

We ask that any producer of one of these devices please accompany each model with a unique serial number embedded in the design or printed on it in the form "COUNTRY_CODE-REGION_CODE-SHORT_NAME-ITEM_CODE".  You can register your serial number prefixes and get more instructions and examples in generating them uniquely [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1syv6CIsPNBiwmLwiizoeUnhXyJUc2MuXfRhm88BrM9c/edit?usp=sharing).

These serial numbers will be used to track items for global Quality-Assurance purposes as they go through testing or use in medical systems.  Failure to uniquely register your serial number may cause rejection of the device, so be sure to check that yours has not been registered already or uses an invalid format.  Public contact info is suggested but not required.  (You will need to share that with hospitals though, should you be providing your devices to them)

At this stage also please inscribe "DEMONSTRATION ONLY" on all produced devices.


## Message to Manufacturers

If you are interested in creating ventilators based on the ARMEE Ventilator design: thank you - we greatly appreciate your help.

We have the following general advice for you, but would welcome any discussion in our channel at HelpfulEngineering.org #project-oscillating-ventilator, or email at contact@armeevent.com.  We expect an influx of responses, but will try to compile answers to those here and in our [latest documentation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZnPGnA-GKtFLsJEDVVLLKqNAKSk3q6F47YqvtuoJVXw)
Please check there before asking if you can, to help us respond to the most pressing new questions.

First off, as said in the root of this Github repository, this is currently NOT a medical device and has no certification by any approving regulatory body in any country.  We do not assume any liability with these schematics nor offer any warranty.  If you build devices incorporating this design and use them for any application, it is up to you to verify the performance is suitable for your application and complies with all applicable laws.  Manufacturing this device in light of this lack of regulatory approval is a risky act, and we do not ask any manufacturer to do it.

In light of this, if you want to help but are not comfortable manufacturing yet on your own, we recommend you look out to your regional authorities for regulatory approval, look to this repo for more info, updates on testing confidence, and design updates - or visit us in our discussion channel at HelpfulEngineering.org #project-oscillating-ventilator.  In the meantime, the best thing you can do is prepare production, familiarizing yourself with the processes involved, testing first prints, and coordinating production estimates with your local authorities.  Be ready for their go-ahead, should your country/state need the supplies.

To help regulators, we offer a repository of accumulated test data to help build confidence in these designs, but ultimately it will be up to each individual manufacturer and their governing regulatory body to decide for themselves what is an acceptable liability risk.  We offer usage instructions to help minimize that risk and suggestions for equipment that might accompany this device, along with schematics and videos where appropriate.  We offer documentation, though this is still a work-in-progress and should always be considered inferior to real-life test data with a working model by a medical professional in a proper testing environment. 

We strongly recommend any device produced using these designs be verified by a medical professional using trustworthy test equipment prior to any other use (even after regulatory approval).  We can not speak for the variation between models in a manufacturing batch and leave that up to industry professionals to decide (please contribute your advice to this repo).  We warn that this design is highly dependent on small details like channel width and angle, so a batch with even small variations may produce different test results.

We do offer a calibration procedure, using set screws, which we hope will partially make up for variation once performed, but we can not guarantee this.  See [Calibration Test](../tests/calibration) for procedure instructions.  It is likely that, even if all devices in a batch can be calibrated the same, their pressure/volume curves may still deviate from each other the further away from the target calibration you get.  This is why we can only really have recommended usage ranges and levels of confidence.

Overall, we leave this up to the experts to figure out - and hope you will share your knowledge with others.  We will do our best to compile that advice and offer it here - but beware that, again, we can not speak with authority and ultimately the responsibility rests in the hands of producers.

We offer these designs free-of-charge with an Open Source CERN-OHL-S V2 license, permitting manufacturers to reuse designs and charge what they need to for final products.  We are nonetheless aware of many manufacturers who have donated their time and resources to the cause and thank you for that.

Thank you again to all who are interested in this project.  Good luck to you!
