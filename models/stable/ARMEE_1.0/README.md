# ARMEE 1.0

A replica of the original 1965 US Army device.

Modeler: Alex Izvorski

Dimensions were pulled from an MRI scan of a physical museum piece found in a Chicago Gallery [link TODO] which is one of the only known models in existence (so far) of the original 1968 US "Army Emergency Respirator" described (here)[./research/1968_Army_Emergency_Respirator.pdf] by J.W. Joyce, Jr. in association with Harry Diamond Labs.
